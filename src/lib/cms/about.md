I am a California native, based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

My style and own view of teaching asanas (yoga poses) can be described as -

> martial arts meets yogi,
>
> healing, gentle ray of sunshine,
>
> challenging with a focus on alignment & breath,
>
> mellow and wise,
>
> soulful and sweaty,
>
> focused and grounding,
>
> playful flows,
>
> strong and calming,
>
> peaceful moving meditation,
>
> powerful, deep and nourishing,
>
> enthusiastic, playful and energetic,
>
> knowledgeable,
>
> calm & centred with a new perception.
