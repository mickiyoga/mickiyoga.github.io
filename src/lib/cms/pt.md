Personal training is available, with a focus on fitness, posture and flexibility.

## Fitness and flexibility

I am fully qualified with a Certificate III & IV in Fitness and Personal Training from [WYN International Institute](https://www.christopherdell.co/wyn-institute).

As a practicing yogi, my primary training strength is looking at a holistic approach with a
preventative and re-habilitation focus. I then progress to understanding the needs of each
individual, whether it's creating a training program for a busy person with life balance
challenges, or a well-rounded, alignment-based, beastly strength training program.

Each client is carefully provided an initial assessment, which includes information on
commitment, attitude, sleep, nutrition, training and rest. Following with a 6 or 12 week
assessment, access to personal encouragement when you're losing motivation and one-on-one
fitness coaching.
