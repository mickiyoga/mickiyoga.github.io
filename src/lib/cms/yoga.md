On offer is a unique hatha class focusing on a water-flow approach to your health, fitness and wellness. My style integrates the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspect of wellness to create a satisfying session of complete mind and body fitness.

I have over 20 years experience as a practitioner of yoga and martial arts, with an RYT-200 instructor certification from [Santosha Yoga Institute](https://santoshayogainstitute.edu.au/yoga-teacher-training/200-hour-ytt-bali/).

My yoga journey started whilst seeking relaxation and rest from the busyness of living in a fast paced world of study and work. My martial arts practice ranges, from Aikido to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to Muay Thai.

I am passionate about breathing in and living in the present moment, using yoga to encourage peaceful meditation. My classes are full of joyful variations suitable for practitioners of any experience level, at any stage of life.

For the most junior yogis, I'm certified in children's yoga with [It's Yoga Kids](https://www.itsyogakids.com/training), and have a Working With Children Check.
