        Personal training is available, with a focus on fitness, posture and flexibility.
      .block. 
        As a practicing yogi, my primary training strength is looking at a holistic approach with a
        preventative and re-habilitation focus. I then progress to understanding the needs of each
        individual, whether it's creating a training program for a busy person with life balance challenges,
        or a well-rounded, alignment-based, beastly strength training program.

        Each client is carefully provided an initial assessment, which includes information on commitment,
        attitude, sleep, nutrition, training and rest. Following with a 6 or 12 week assessment, access to
        personal encouragement when you're losing motivation and one-on-one fitness coaching.
      .block.
        Sessions offered are individual, small group, and large group training classes. All
        classes may be indoor, outdoor or bootcamp style.
      .block.
        Each package purchased includes one free private yoga class and optional NLP session.
