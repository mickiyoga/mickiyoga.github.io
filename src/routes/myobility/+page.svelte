    <p>Myobility can help you stay in alignment with your divine health.</p>
    <p>
      Research suggests that most issues in the body are caused by connective tissue tension. It
      also shows that mechanical receptors in our skin sense tension pulling on the cell wall and if
      pulled just enough they compress on various muscles and meridians.

    <p>
      They denature the DNA at the nucleus level making the body the body less optimally functional.

    <p>
      With the myobility bar we are able to release fascia and major tension points almost
      instantly, either reducing or eliminating pain points so you can freely move and regain mental
      independence.
